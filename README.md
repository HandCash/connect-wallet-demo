## Handcash Client and Wallet Context

The [Handcash client](src/lib/handcash-client.ts) contains all the methods required to interact with the Handcash Wallet Service, including wallet creation, balance fetching, and transaction management.

Server-side actions for wallet-related tasks are located in [src/app/actions/wallet/](src/app/actions/wallet/) and are used to interact with the Handcash API.

The [`WalletContext`](src/app/context/WalletContext.tsx) is provided to manage the user's wallet state and can be used within components to fetch balances, refresh them, and handle wallet-related operations seamlessly.
