## Handcash Wallet Creation Demo 
This projects demonstrates how to create wallets on behalf of a user.  The original implementation we will call the App Created Wallet flow.
This creates a Handcash guest account on behalf of a user within the Handcash Domain. The new approach will be called the External Wallet flow. 
Where a wallet will be created outside the Handcash domain, this wallet will not be able to sign into Handcash market/ Handcash wallet.
